# Non-negative matrix factorization

NMF has been successfully used to cluster patients using combined proteomics, 
phosphoproteomics, and RNA count datasets. In these applications, the clusters
of samples were found to coincide with previous biological knowledge, suggesting that
NMF could be useful in extracting biological relationships among patients. 
As is common, in addition to the dataset, NMF also requires input on `how many` clusters
to divide the samples into, denoted by \(k\).

It is a stochastic method which factors a non-negative matrix \(M\) into two
non-negative matrices \(M = WH\). The rows of \(W\) correspond to rows (or genes)
of \(M\), while the columns of \(H\) are the columns, or samples of \(M\). The matrix \(H\), 
being non-negative, provides a natural way to assign a cluster to every sample, as the largest
entry in \(H\) in that column. Given that the NMF method is stochastic, the `stability` 
of the clusters provides a method of settling on a single optimal \(k\) value. 

The cophenetic correlation is a common way to measure this stability. Often, the value of \(k\)
giving the largest cophenetic correlation is chosen. The precise clusters are obtained by averaging
the results of many runs. Below, we see the cophenetic correlation for each \(k\) between 2 and 8, using a
total of 50 runs for each \(k\) value.


```{r compute cophenetic, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
ranks <- sapply(results, function(x){
  y = x[[1]]
  y = y@fit@H
  return(dim(y)[[1]])
  })

coph.correlation <- sapply(results, cophcor) %>%
  data.frame(coph.cor = ., k = ranks)

p <- ggplot(coph.correlation, aes(x = k, y = coph.cor)) + geom_line() + 
  ylab("Cophenetic correlation") + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:13)

ggsave(p, filename = "cophenetic correlation.png")

```


```{r show cophenetic}
knitr::include_graphics("cophenetic correlation.png")

```

$$\\[0.1in]$$

As the cophenetic correlation is quite close between these, I selected 4 in particular
which have high cophenetic correlation and/or agreement the FLT3 or Chemotherapy status.

We summarize the results of for each \(k\) value below.
Each one is the result of averaging 50 individual NMF clusters, and  is represented as a heatmap.  
Both the rows and columns are samples. For a pair of samples \((S_1, S_2)\), the value seen plotted is 
the proportion of times the two samples are assigned to the same cluster by the algorithm. They can
also be interpreted as the probability that the samples belong to the same cluster. 
Red blocks correspond to the various clusters, while a darker color (red or blue) indicates more 
consensus among the clustering results.

We also annotate the FLT3 and Chemotherapy status of the patients, to see if these coincide with 
the clusters.


```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
samples.common <- colnames(adjacencies[[1]])
titles <- paste("Consensus map k =", 2:8)
paths <- paste0("consensus_map_k_", 2:8, ".png")

ann.labels <- meta %>%
  filter(Barcode.ID %in% samples.common) %>%
  select(FLT3.ITD, PostChemotherapy) %>%
  mutate(FLT3.ITD = as.factor(FLT3.ITD),
         PostChemotherapy = as.factor(PostChemotherapy)) 

ann.colors <- lapply(names(ann.labels), function(x) c(`TRUE` = "darkgrey", `FALSE` = "white"))
names(ann.colors) <- names(ann.labels)

### Run this to make the plots shown.
plots <- lapply(1:7, function(i){
  C = adjacencies[[i]]
  png(filename = paths[[i]], width = 1000, height = 1000)
  pheatmap(C, annotation_col = ann.labels, annotation_colors = ann.colors, 
           show_rownames = FALSE, show_colnames = TRUE, main = titles[[i]])
  dev.off()
  return("Done")
})
